- A slug or slug ID is a user-friendly and URL-safe version of a string that is used to identify a specific resource in a web application.
- They should also be unique to avoid conflicts with other resources.
- eg :- `https://example.com/blog/introduction-to-web-development`
- It improves search engine optimization (SEO), and provide a better overall user experience.
