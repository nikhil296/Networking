## Protocols :
- Set of rules and regulations to perform some task.

## Network Protocols :
- Set of rules and regulations setup to communicate and share information over a network.
- eg :- HTTP, UDP, TCP, SMTP, etc.

## Packets :
- In order to share data, we cannot send the entire big chunk of data over the network.  
  So we divide the data in smaller chunks, these chunks are called as packets.
- Having smaller chunks of data makes the overall network more managable, reusable and fast so that  
  we can leverage the whole capacity of the network.
