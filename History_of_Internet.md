## History of Internet :

- **`1957`** :
    - Sovient Union launched their first satellite called `SPUTNIK`.
    - around the same time `USA` established `ARPA (Advance Research and Prject Agency)`. 

- **`1960 - 70's`** : 
    - around this time the `ARPA` computers were facing the issue where it was getting
    difficult for their systems/computers to talk to each other and hence data was shared manually.
    So they developed a communication system for their computers to talk to each other.

- **`1969`** :
    - `ARPANET (Advance Research and Prject Agency Network)` was established to solve the 
        above mentioned problem.

- **`1980's`** :
    - around this time the ARPA people started progressing from `TCP` towards `TCP/IP`
     and thus gave the birth to **`Internet`** 
    - So now apart from ARPA's computers, other USA government computers, research organizations
    academic computers started getting added to Internet.

- **`1990's`** :
    - the researchers at `CERN` felt the need to share the information, and they were using 
                Hyperlink based documents at that time. So they atarted using Internet as well.

- **`1990`** :
    - In the year 1990 **`Time Berner Lee`** introduced **`World Wide Web`**

- **`World Wide Web`** : 
    - The World Wide Web (WWW or simply the Web) is a system of interlinked hypertext documents
    accessed via the Internet. It was invented by Sir Tim Berners-Lee in 1989 while he was working
    at CERN, the European Particle Physics Laboratory, in Switzerland.
    
    - The Web consists of billions of web pages that are hosted on servers all around the world. These
    web pages are linked together using hyperlinks, allowing users to navigate from one page to
    another by clicking on links. The Web is accessed using web browsers such as Google Chrome
    Mozilla Firefox, Safari, or Internet Explorer.
    
    - The initial browsers were -{`Mosaic`, `NetScape`, etc.}
    
    - There on the evolution of web has happend to `Web 2.0` and so came the social network and
        everything.
