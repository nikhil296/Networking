# HTTP/3  vs  HTTPs  :-
1. ***`HTTP/3`*** :
- HTTP/3 is the latest version of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and is based on the QUIC transport protocol.

2. ***`HTTPS`*** :
- `HTTPS stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure`.
- It is an `extension of HTTP that adds an extra layer of security through SSL/TLS encryption`.
- HTTPS ensures that data transmitted between a client (such as a web browser) and a server is encrypted, protecting it from eavesdropping and tampering.
- HTTPS uses SSL/TLS certificates to establish secure connections and verify the authenticity of the server.
- It is widely used for secure communication over the internet, particularly for websites that handle sensitive information like passwords, credit card details, etc.
- `HTTPS operates on top of the HTTP protocol, providing the same functionality while adding encryption and security features.`
