## Domain  vs  Host :-
- `Domain` :
    - A domain refers to a logical grouping of devices or resources on a network.
    - A domain can represent a collection of interconnected devices or a specific administrative boundary. For example, a company may have its own domain for internal network resources.

- `Host` :
    - A host, on the other hand, refers to a specific device or computer connected to a network.
    - It can be a physical machine or a virtual instance. 
    - Each host on a network is identified by an IP address, which serves as a unique identifier for communication purposes. 
    - In the context of web hosting, a host is a server that stores and serves website content to users.
- eg :-
    - consider the example of a website with the domain name "example.com." 
    - In this case, "example.com" represents the domain, which encompasses all the resources associated with that domain, such as web pages, email addresses, and subdomains. 
    - The actual computer or server that hosts the website, which is identified by an IP address, is considered the host.
- ***In summary, a domain represents a logical grouping or administrative boundary, while a host refers to a specific device or server connected to a network.***
